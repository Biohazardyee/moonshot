## Document Overview

This document serves as a placeholder for all the ideas that came to mind while initializing the Moonshot project. It will track ideas from my first year at [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/en.html) to my final year.

## Ideas

### First Idea - Rejected

The first Moonshot idea is a visionary concept for a highly realistic flight simulator aimed at both military training and aviation enthusiasts. The simulator would model airplanes in intricate detail, employing realistic physics, embedded systems, and real-time weather data for an immersive experience akin to real-world flying. Core features include a comprehensive mission editor for customizable scenarios, VR integration for enhanced immersion, and possibly a motion platform to simulate G-forces. My father, a former fighter pilot, could provide valuable insights, helping bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Good evening Franck,  
Apologies for reaching out to you at this late hour.  
I wanted to discuss about my moonshot idea.  

My concept involves creating an incredibly realistic flight simulator. I envision a simulator that strives for absolute authenticity, modeling airplanes with embedded systems, employing realistic physics, and mirroring real aircraft construction and behavior. Achieving this would require extensive documentation and input from pilots, but I believe it's achievable.  

Moreover, I'm considering implementing a detailed map that mirrors our current world, a bit like what Microsoft Flight Simulator offers. This map could sync directly with real-time weather data or allow user modifications.  

This concept extends to a mission editor, allowing users to alter various parameters like weather, locations, and even the behavior of AI models towards the player.  
To elevate the experience further, I'm keen on integrating VR technology. This would provide users with immersive sense of what it feels like to fly.  

I have numerous innovative ideas to explore, aiming to push the boundaries of existing flight simulation. I'm committed to seeing this project succeed and create a next-generation flight simulator that closely mirrors reality. I also have contacts through my father, a former fighter pilot, which could provide invaluable insights and feedback.  

This simulator is primarily targeted towards the military, intended as a training tool for pilots and mission preparation. Hence, the mission editor is crucial for its functionality.  

But will also aim to jet and planes enthusiasts that want to have a perception of what it really is like and what it takes to be a fighter pilot.  
While this project entails extensive modeling, development, and AI creation, I am confident that with dedication, I can create a highly detailed and authentic flight simulator.  

I've only scratched the surface with some brainstormed ideas. If you have any questions or feedback, I would greatly appreciate hearing them.  
This "game" isn't just a game; it's meant to be a tool for current and aspiring pilots to experience flying realistically through a computer. Perhaps one day, technology will advance to the point where the line between reality and simulation blurs entirely.  

While projects like Digital Combat Simulator strive for realism, I aim to take it further by creating something affordable, authentic, and truly immersive. I even envision the possibility of incorporating a motion platform to replicate the G-forces experienced in an airplane, adding an extra layer of realism.  

Thank you for your time, and please feel free to share any thoughts or feedback on this idea.  
Best regards,  
Thibaud Marlier

Hi Thibaud, first of all congratulations on your text; it's very well written.  
I think the project is extremely ambitious (possibly too ambitious) as existing flight simulators are already very good and realistic while being developed by teams of hundreds of developers.  
I think you should keep the domain but narrow it down. I'm not an expert, but the thing about real-time weather data piqued my interest. Maybe it is something you could focus on.

#### Rescale

Thank you for your feedback,  
Upon reflecting on your feedback, I realize that the scale of the initial project is too ambitious, considering the competition in the market. Narrowing the subject is crucial, and the idea of real-time weather data in aviation is striking me.  
I will dig deeper into this subject by collecting insights from my father and what's available on the internet about aircraft. As far as I know, aircraft are currently capable of seeing weather information via radar, but they don't have any way to plan changes in weather after the pre-flight meeting. The concept of an in-cockpit weather forecast seems less explored.  

I'm intrigued by the potential of an embedded AI-powered weather forecasting system, a technology that is rapidly gaining recognition among meteorologists for its precision. This system could warn pilots in real-time about weather changes on their route or nearby. This tool could apply to civil aviation and military aviation and thus on every type of aircraft.  

Moreover, this project holds the potential for everyday use. AI-powered weather forecasting has already been proven to surpass human precision. It offers a more accurate and long-term weather forecast.  

Tell me what you think about this new idea,  
Thank you,  
Kind regards.

Good morning Franck,  
I hope this message finds you well,  
I've done some research and found a pretty interesting and detailed article on how an AI-powered weather forecast system would benefit the aviation industry.  
<https://www.tomorrow.io/blog/using-weather-ai-to-improve-operations-in-aviation/>  
It's definitely worth a look.

#### Article Summary

<https://www.tomorrow.io/blog/using-weather-ai-to-improve-operations-in-aviation/>  

The article on Tomorrow.io discusses how AI-driven weather forecasting can enhance aviation operations by improving safety, efficiency, and reliability. Key points include:

- Optimized Flight Routing: AI models can analyze vast weather data in real-time to suggest optimal routes, helping airlines avoid severe weather, turbulence, and other disruptive conditions. This reduces delays, saves fuel, and enhances passenger comfort.

- Operational Planning: Airports and airlines use weather data for planning and resource allocation. For example, advanced AI weather models can predict ground conditions that affect runway availability, fueling, and de-icing requirements, helping reduce turnaround times.

- Minimizing Disruptions: By anticipating weather changes, AI can help airlines make proactive decisions to delay, reroute, or cancel flights before passengers even arrive at the airport. This reduces congestion, customer dissatisfaction, and additional logistical costs.

- Climate Resilience: AI weather systems can help the aviation industry adapt to climate change, where weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable. Better forecasting enables long-term planning for infrastructure and resource adjustments to cope with increased weather variability.

In essence, AI-based weather forecasting allows airlines and airports to plan with more precision, reduce operational costs, improve safety, and enhance the passenger experience, while also addressing the challenges posed by changing climate patterns.

### Second Idea - Ongoing

The second Moonshot idea is to create an AI-powered weather forecasting system that leverages real-time meteorological data from multiple global sources to deliver highly accurate, short- and long-term weather forecasts. The system is designed with two primary user groups in mind:

- **Flight Planning Teams**: This AI-driven system would aid flight planning teams in selecting optimal routes by providing detailed weather predictions. With this information, teams could avoid severe conditions, optimize fuel efficiency, and enhance overall safety in route planning.

- **Pilots**: A dedicated mobile application would supply pilots with real-time weather updates during flights. This app would display live forecasts and provide alerts for sudden weather changes, allowing pilots to make informed decisions on rerouting and other safety measures as conditions evolve.

The project aims to reduce operational costs, improve fuel efficiency, and streamline logistical planning at airports. By accurately predicting potential weather disruptions, the system could minimize passenger inconvenience by preventing unnecessary delays and cancellations, thus enhancing airport operations and the passenger experience.

#### Key Objectives

- Utilize a broad network of real-time meteorological data sources worldwide, collecting as much data as possible to create a highly accurate predictive model.
- Develop a model that is both error-resistant and resource-efficient, allowing it to function effectively across various devices and platforms.

The end goal is to deliver a robust, scalable forecasting tool that serves both aviation professionals and passengers while setting a new standard for reliability and precision in weather forecasting technology.
